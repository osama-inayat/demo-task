# Codary Werkstudenten Coding Challenge

In one of the steps in our booking process the user has to select a cohort, in our system a cohort is a group of children participating in a course together. A cohort always meets at a certain day and time and has a dedicated coach. Before this step the user has already chosen the course he wants to book.

Your task is to create a one-page app that lets the user select a cohort.

For that you need to do:
* Create mockup cohorts in `store.ts`
* Display all cohorts
* Display all the cohorts that a user is member of
* Let user choose a cohort

Feel free to create as many cohorts in the `store.ts` file as you like. The data schema of courses, users, and cohorts is described in `models.ts`.
